Documentation
=============

This is where in depth documentation will be going.

## Customization Options

Check out most of the customization options [here](CUSTOMIZATION.md).

## Customization using state builder

Some of the customization can be made using a builder. Using a builder for those parameters helps preventing bugs and improves performances.
Those parameters are:

- [First Day Of Week](CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#first-day-of-the-week)
- [Minimum Date](CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#date-ranges)
- [Maximum Date](CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#date-ranges)
- [Calendar Display Mode](CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#calendar-display-mode)

The documentation is available [here](CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md).

## Events, Highlighting, Custom Selectors, and More!

All of this and more can be done via the decorator api. Please check out the [decorator documentation](DECORATORS.md).

## Custom Selectors and Colors

If you provide custom drawables or colors, you'll want to make sure they respond to state.
Check out the [documentation for custom states](CUSTOM_SELECTORS.md).

## TODO

- Write and organize the documentation. Focus on customization with real world scenarios.
- Improve performances.
- Add test cases.
